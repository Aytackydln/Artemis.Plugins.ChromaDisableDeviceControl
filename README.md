## Modules
- Disable device with Artemis launch
- Disable Synapse bloat with every Artemis launch. This will prevent unnecessary Razer software while keeping game integrations

This plugin requires admin privilages, so using this will make Artemis restart with admin privileges each time it runs.

To make the launch faster, make the shortcut and startup task run as administrator.
